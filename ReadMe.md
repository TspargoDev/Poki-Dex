# PokeDex Project

# Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to view a list of Pokémon and their details. Throughout the development of this application, I have learned various fundamental and advanced concepts of JavaScript, as well as utilizing libraries and frameworks to enhance user interfaces and experiences.

# Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the web application.
- CSS: Styling the application, with custom styles and Bootstrap for responsive design.
- JavaScript: Core programming language for functionality and interactivity.
- jQuery: Simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Bootstrap: Framework for responsive design and UI components.
- APIs: Fetching data asynchronously to display Pokémon information.

# Key Learnings

- Understanding the role of JavaScript as a programming language for web development, enabling interactivity and dynamic content.
- Fundamental concepts including variables, data types, and basic operators.
- Exploration of control structures such as loops and conditionals.
- Advanced function concepts, including higher-order functions and callbacks.
- Learning to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to change HTML and CSS through JavaScript.
- Understanding how to interact with APIs to fetch and manipulate data asynchronously using AJAX.
- Implementing design patterns and best practices in JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface.
- Using jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation, event handling, and animations.
- Utilizing Bootstrap to create a responsive layout and enhance UI components easily.
